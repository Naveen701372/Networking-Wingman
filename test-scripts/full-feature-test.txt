Hey! I'm Navi, nice to meet you.
Hi Navi! I'm Soren Ekberg, lead robotics engineer at Boston Dynamics. I work on the autonomous navigation stack for our warehouse robots.
That's fascinating. What kind of environments are they operating in?
Mostly large fulfillment centers. We just deployed a fleet of sixty units at a major retailer. They navigate around humans with zero incidents so far.
I'd love to see them in action. Can you arrange a facility tour?
Definitely, shoot me an email at soren at bostondynamics dot com and I'll set it up for next month.
Will do. Great meeting you Soren.

Hey there, I'm Navi.
Navi! I'm Talia Russo, co-founder and CEO of MindBridge. We're building an AI therapist companion app for teens dealing with anxiety.
Mental health tech for teens, that's so needed right now. How does it work?
It's a conversational agent trained on CBT techniques. We partnered with Johns Hopkins to validate the clinical outcomes. Early results show a forty percent reduction in anxiety scores.
That's real impact. I know a health tech journalist at Wired who'd love this story. Let me introduce you two.
That would be amazing. Here's my number, just text me whenever.
On it. Nice meeting you Talia.

Hi! I'm Navi.
Hey! I'm Kofi Mensah, principal engineer at Databricks. I lead the real-time streaming team for their lakehouse platform.
Databricks is everywhere these days. What's the biggest challenge with real-time?
Exactly-once semantics at petabyte scale. We just shipped a new checkpointing system that cut recovery time from minutes to under three seconds.
That's impressive engineering. I'm dealing with real-time audio streams and could use advice on buffering strategies. Can we do a thirty-minute call next week?
Sure thing, grab a slot on my Calendly. I'll DM you the link on LinkedIn.
Perfect. Great to meet you Kofi.

Excuse me, mind if I join? I'm Navi.
Not at all! I'm Vera Sokolova, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. I invest in developer tools and infrastructure.
Developer tools is exactly my world. What's your thesis right now?
I'm really bullish on AI-native dev environments. Tools that don't just autocomplete but actually understand your entire codebase and architecture.
That resonates with what I'm building. I'd love to send you a quick overview of our product.
Please do. Send it to vera at lsvp dot com and include any traction metrics you have. I'll review it within the week.
You'll have it by Wednesday. Thanks Vera.

Hey! I'm Navi.
Hi! I'm Dante Oliveira, creative director at Pixar. I lead the procedural animation research group.
Pixar and procedural animation? That must be a dream job.
It really is. We're using diffusion models to generate crowd scenes now. What used to take weeks of manual animation takes about two hours.
That's mind-blowing. My team works with real-time audio AI. I think there could be an interesting crossover with lip-sync generation. Could you share any published research on your diffusion approach?
We have a SIGGRAPH paper coming out in August. I'll send you the preprint once it's ready.
I'd love that. Nice meeting you Dante.

Hey there, I'm Navi.
Navi, hey! I'm Freya Andersen, head of machine learning at Spotify. I run the audio understanding team.
Audio understanding at Spotify, that's right in my wheelhouse. What are you focused on?
We're building models that understand the emotional arc of a song or podcast episode. It powers our mood-based playlists and ad placement.
Emotional arc detection is brilliant. I'm working on real-time sentiment in conversations. We should compare architectures. Can I buy you lunch next Tuesday?
Tuesday works. There's a great ramen place near our office in Manhattan. I'll send you the address.
Looking forward to it. Great meeting you Freya.

Hi! I'm Navi.
Hey! I'm Idris Kante, founder of NexaGrid. We build decentralized energy trading platforms for solar microgrids in West Africa.
Clean energy and blockchain, that's a powerful combo. How many communities are you serving?
About three hundred villages across Ghana and Senegal. Households sell excess solar power to their neighbors through our app. We just crossed a million transactions.
A million transactions, that's incredible. I have a friend at the Gates Foundation working on energy access. Let me connect you.
That could be transformative for us. Send me a WhatsApp message, here's my number.
I'll reach out tonight. Great meeting you Idris.

Hey, I'm Navi.
Hi Navi! I'm Mika Sato, staff engineer at Tesla. I work on the full self-driving perception pipeline.
FSD perception, that's high stakes. What sensor fusion approach are you using?
Pure vision now, no lidar. We process about two thousand frames per second across eight cameras with a custom transformer architecture.
Pure vision at that scale is bold. I'd love to understand your latency optimization tricks for on-device inference. Can you share any technical talks or blog posts?
We're doing an internal tech talk at the AI hardware summit in April. I can get you a guest pass.
That would be awesome. I'll follow up with you on LinkedIn. Nice meeting you Mika.

Hey there! I'm Navi.
Hi! I'm Zuri Abrams, director of engineering at Figma. I lead the multiplayer collaboration infrastructure team.
Figma's real-time collab is best in class. What's under the hood?
CRDTs with a custom conflict resolution layer. We handle about five million concurrent editing sessions at peak. We're now extending it to support AI agents as collaborators.
AI agents as collaborators in Figma, that's wild. I'm building real-time AI for conversations. We should swap notes on low-latency sync protocols. Can we set up a video call this month?
Absolutely. Email me at zuri at figma dot com and we'll find a time. I'll also share our engineering blog series on CRDTs.
Looking forward to it. Great meeting you Zuri.

Hey! I'm Navi.
Navi, hi! I'm Oscar Brennan, co-founder of VoiceForge. We make AI voice cloning tools for game studios and animation houses.
Voice cloning for games, that's a fun space. How realistic are the voices?
We can clone a voice from thirty seconds of audio with ninety-seven percent similarity. Ubisoft and Riot Games are both using us for NPC dialogue.
Thirty seconds to clone, that's wild. I work with real-time audio too. We should explore a partnership for live voice transformation. Can you send me your SDK docs?
For sure, I'll email you the developer portal link and an API key so you can play around with it.
That's generous. I'll send you my email on LinkedIn. Great meeting you Oscar.
