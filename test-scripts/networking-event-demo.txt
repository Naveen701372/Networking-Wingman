Hey there! I'm Navi, great event tonight.
Hi Navi! I'm Riya Patel, Director of Applied AI at Stripe. We're building a fraud detection system that processes two billion transactions a day using graph attention networks.
Two billion a day? How do you keep latency under control at that scale?
We run inference at the edge with quantized models. P99 latency is under twelve milliseconds. The trick was moving from batch scoring to streaming evaluation with a custom Kafka pipeline.
That's wild. I'm building a real-time conversation AI that captures networking contacts from live audio. We have similar streaming challenges.
Oh interesting. You should look into our open-source stream processing library, Rainforest. It handles backpressure really well for ML workloads.
I'll check it out this week. What's your team like?
Twenty-two engineers across San Francisco and Bangalore. We're actively hiring a senior ML platform engineer. Know anyone good?
I might actually. Let me dig through my network and send you some names on LinkedIn.
Perfect. Also, my colleague Amir runs our developer partnerships. He'd love to chat about integrating your tool with Stripe's merchant dashboard.

Hey, mind if I join? I'm Navi.
Not at all! I'm Mateo Silva, founder and CEO of Canopy Robotics. We build autonomous drones for precision agriculture. Series B, just raised thirty-five million from Andreessen.
Autonomous ag drones? What crops are you focused on?
Started with vineyards in Napa, now we cover almonds, avocados, and coffee plantations across three continents. Our drones do real-time crop health analysis using hyperspectral imaging.
How do you handle the regulatory side? Drone regulations are a nightmare.
Tell me about it. We spent eighteen months getting FAA Part 137 certification. Now we're the only autonomous ag drone company with full commercial clearance in the US, Brazil, and Kenya.
That's a massive moat. We deal with regulatory-adjacent stuff too, privacy compliance for audio capture.
Yeah privacy is everything. We actually built a data sovereignty layer so crop data never leaves the country of origin. Farmers own their data completely.
Smart. I know a couple of agtech investors who'd be interested in your Series B story. Want me to make intros?
That would be amazing. Also, we're demoing at CES next month. I can get you a VIP pass if you want to see the drones in action.
Count me in. I'll follow up with you tomorrow.

Recall, who was the person from Stripe?

Navi! Over here!
Hey! Who am I meeting?
This is Aisha Okonkwo. She runs the climate tech accelerator at Y Combinator.
Hi Navi! Aisha Okonkwo, partner at YC. I focus on climate, energy, and sustainability startups. We just graduated our biggest climate cohort ever, fourteen companies.
That's incredible. What trends are you seeing in climate tech right now?
Three big ones. Carbon capture is finally hitting commercial viability. Grid-scale battery storage is the new gold rush. And AI for climate modeling is attracting serious talent from big tech.
We're not climate tech but our AI approach to real-time data processing could apply to sensor networks and monitoring.
Absolutely. One of our portfolio companies, TerraWatch, does exactly that. Real-time satellite monitoring of deforestation. They'd love your streaming architecture expertise.
I'd be happy to chat with them. What's the best way to connect?
I'll email you their CTO's details tonight. Also, we're hosting a climate tech demo day in March. Would you want to judge? We need technical founders who understand AI infrastructure.
I'd be honored. Send me the details and I'm there.
Amazing. Here's my card. And seriously, talk to Mateo about his drone data. There might be a collaboration angle with TerraWatch.

I can't remember the name of the drone company founder.

Excuse me, are you in the AI track? I'm Navi.
Yes! I'm Soren Lindqvist, principal research scientist at DeepMind. I lead the multimodal reasoning team. We just published a paper on emergent tool use in language models.
Emergent tool use? Like models figuring out how to use APIs on their own?
Exactly. We found that at sufficient scale, models spontaneously develop the ability to chain tool calls without explicit training. It's both exciting and terrifying from an alignment perspective.
We use LLMs for entity extraction and the confidence calibration is really tricky. Any insights?
Use contrastive decoding. Run the same prompt at two temperatures and measure the KL divergence between output distributions. High divergence means the model is uncertain. It's more principled than just looking at logprobs.
That's brilliant. I'm implementing that next sprint.
Happy to review your approach. I also run a reading group on reliable AI systems every Thursday. You should join, it's on Discord.
I'd love that. Send me the invite link.
Will do. And my colleague Mei at Google Brain is working on real-time speech understanding. Very relevant to what you're building. Want me to connect you two?
Absolutely. I'll follow up with you by Friday.

Recall, find the YC climate partner.

Riya! Great running into you again.
Navi! Small world. Listen, I talked to Amir about your app and he's really excited. He wants to schedule a technical deep dive next Wednesday.
That's fantastic, thanks for pushing that forward.
Of course. Also, I forgot to mention earlier, we're launching a startup integration program next quarter. Early-stage companies get free API access plus dedicated support. You should definitely apply.
I'm on it. By the way, I just met Soren from DeepMind. His work on contrastive decoding could really improve our fraud detection confidence scores too.
Oh I know Soren's work. His emergent tool use paper was incredible. Send me his contact and I'll reach out about a research collaboration.
Done. Great seeing you again Riya.
You too! Don't forget, Wednesday with Amir. I'll send the calendar invite tonight.
