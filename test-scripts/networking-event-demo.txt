Hey! I'm Navi. Love the venue for this summit.
Right? I'm Amara Osei, head of ML infrastructure at Shopify. We're rebuilding our recommendation engine from scratch using graph neural networks.
Graph neural networks for e-commerce? That's a bold move.
It's paying off. Product discovery improved by thirty-seven percent since we switched from collaborative filtering. The graph captures relationships between products, sellers, and buyer behavior that flat models miss completely.
I'm building a real-time conversation AI that captures networking contacts from live audio. We deal with similar graph-like relationship problems between people.
Fascinating. You should look into our open-source graph embedding library, ShopGraph. It handles streaming updates which sounds relevant for your real-time use case.
I'll check it out this week. What's your team size?
Fourteen engineers across Toronto and Berlin. We're hiring a senior ML ops engineer if you know anyone.
I might actually. I'll send you a couple of names on LinkedIn.
Perfect. Also grab a coffee with my colleague Yuki Watanabe, she runs developer relations at Shopify and would love to feature your project in our partner showcase.

Is this the AI ethics panel overflow? I'm Navi.
Ha, yeah it's packed in there. I'm Santiago Morales, research scientist at DeepMind. I work on alignment and interpretability for large language models.
That's heavy stuff. What's the current state of interpretability?
Honestly, we're still in the dark ages. We can probe individual neurons but understanding emergent behavior at scale is like trying to understand a city by studying individual bricks. My team just published a paper on circuit-level analysis that's getting some traction though.
We use LLMs for entity extraction in our app and calibrating confidence is a nightmare. Any advice?
Use ensemble disagreement as your confidence signal. Run the same prompt through two different temperature settings and measure output divergence. High divergence means low confidence. It's cheap and surprisingly effective.
That's genius. I'm implementing that next sprint.
Here's my card. Also, my PhD advisor Ingrid Bergström at ETH Zurich runs the Trustworthy AI Lab. She's consulting for startups on responsible AI deployment. Want an intro?
Absolutely. I'll follow up with you by Friday.

Navi! Over here by the demo stations!
Amara! How was the graph neural networks talk?
Incredible. But forget that, meet Tomoko Hayashi.
Hi Navi! Tomoko Hayashi, co-founder and CTO of Voxel Health. We build spatial computing interfaces for surgical planning using Apple Vision Pro.
Surgical planning in mixed reality? How do surgeons respond to that?
Skeptical at first, then they can't go back. We've done over two thousand pre-surgical visualizations across fifteen hospitals. Complication rates dropped by twenty-two percent in our clinical trial.
The spatial computing space is exploding. We've thought about building a spatial UI for our networking app too.
You should. The interaction paradigm is completely different from flat screens. We learned that the hard way. Took us eight months to unlearn mobile design patterns.
What's your biggest technical challenge right now?
Real-time volumetric rendering from CT scans. We need sub-frame latency for the surgeon to trust the visualization. We're using custom Metal shaders but hitting memory limits on the M2 chip.
I know someone at Apple's spatial computing team. I'll try to connect you.
That would be incredible. We're presenting our clinical results at WWDC next month if you want to come.
Count me in. I'll send you my contact details tonight.

Excuse me, are you in the startup track? I'm Navi.
Yes! I'm Liam O'Brien, founder of Cadence Analytics. We do real-time sentiment analysis for live customer support calls. Series A, just raised twelve million from Accel.
Sentiment analysis on live calls? We're in adjacent spaces. Our app does entity extraction from live conversations.
No way. What's your transcription stack?
Deepgram for speech-to-text with a custom speaker attribution layer on top. You?
We use a fine-tuned Whisper model hosted on our own infrastructure. Latency is around three hundred milliseconds end to end.
That's impressive. We're at about four hundred. How do you handle accent variation?
We trained on a diverse dataset with forty-seven accent categories. The key insight was that accent-specific fine-tuning actually hurt generalization. A single robust model with accent-aware data augmentation works better.
That's counterintuitive but makes sense. I'd love to compare architectures.
Let's do a technical deep dive next week. I'll share our benchmarks if you share yours.
Deal. Also, my investor Sarah Chen at Accel is looking at more audio AI companies. Want me to set up a warm intro?
That would be amazing. I'll have our deck ready by Wednesday.

Santiago! Good to see you again.
Navi! Small conference, big ideas. Listen, I want you to meet someone. This is Zara Hussain.
Hey Navi. Zara Hussain, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. I focus on AI infrastructure and developer tools.
Santiago's been telling me about your real-time extraction approach. Walk me through the architecture.
We capture live audio, run it through Deepgram for transcription, then use an LLM pipeline for entity extraction, reconciliation, and deduplication. All in real-time as the conversation happens.
What's your unit economics look like? LLM costs per conversation?
We're tracking that closely. Currently about two cents per five-minute conversation on DeepSeek, but we're optimizing the extraction pipeline to reduce token usage by batching context windows.
Smart. The companies that win in AI infrastructure are the ones obsessing over cost efficiency from day one. Send me your metrics dashboard and let's schedule a partner meeting next Tuesday.
I'll have everything ready. Thanks Zara.
Looking forward to it. Here's my direct line.
