Hey! I'm Navi. What brings you to the conference?
Hi Navi! I'm Elena Vasquez, CTO at Terravolt. We build autonomous microgrids for off-grid communities in Latin America using reinforcement learning to optimize energy distribution.
That's amazing. How many communities are you serving?
Twenty-three across Colombia and Peru, about fourteen thousand people. We just signed with the Ecuadorian government for forty more villages.
I'm building a conversation AI tool that captures networking contacts in real time. Similar real-time processing challenges.
You should meet my co-founder Marco Reyes. He built our NLP pipeline for processing community feedback in Spanish and Quechua. I'll connect you two.
That'd be great. I'll follow up this week.
Also, we're presenting our impact report tomorrow at two in Hall B. Swing by!

Mind if I sit here? I'm Navi.
Go for it! I'm Jordan Okafor, principal engineer at Datadog. I lead anomaly detection.
What's the biggest challenge at that scale?
Alert fatigue. We ingest forty trillion data points daily. We built a correlation engine that groups related anomalies into incidents, reduced alert volume by eighty-five percent.
I deal with similar signal-to-noise issues. My app extracts contacts from live conversations and the tricky part is knowing what's important versus background noise.
How do you handle speaker separation in noisy environments?
We use Deepgram with our own speaker attribution layer on top. Not perfect but it gets better with more context.
My teammate Reina Kobayashi is working on real-time streaming ML. She's giving a talk tomorrow, "Sub-50ms ML Inference at Scale," Room 2C at nine thirty.
I'll be there. Thanks Jordan.

Hey! I'm Navi. Waiting for the keynote?
Hi! Maya Chen, head of product at Anthropic. I work on the Claude consumer experience.
What's the biggest design challenge with conversational AI?
Managing expectations. We spend a lot of time on graceful boundaries. When Claude doesn't know something, it should say so helpfully.
That resonates. I'm building an AI networking tool and confidence calibration is everything. Wrong extractions kill trust instantly.
We track correction rate. How often users edit AI outputs. Sweet spot is five to eight percent. Zero means people aren't engaging.
That's a great metric. Do you know anyone in real-time audio AI? Our transcription pipeline needs work.
Talk to Tomás Herrera at Assembly AI. They just published on streaming transcription with sub-200ms latency. I'll intro you.
Perfect. Thanks Maya.

Navi! It's Jordan again.
Jordan! How was Reina's talk?
Standing room only. Listen, I told my VP about your project. Aisha Patel runs partnerships and wants to set up a call about Datadog's marketplace.
That could be huge for distribution.
Also met David Kim, partner at Greylock. He's looking at AI productivity tools and wants to see your demo. I'll set up a group chat.
You're my unofficial biz dev team. Thanks Jordan.
That's what conferences are for. See you at the closing session.
